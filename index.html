          The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California.
          The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists,
          a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved its first commercial
          success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from their future manager. Having
          extensive experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
          confident the band could succeed even further with more support, pushing The
          Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.
        </p>
        <p class="article__content">
          From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking
          in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the
          band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
          hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately
          refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic
          performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their second
          studio album, looking to be released in early 2024.
